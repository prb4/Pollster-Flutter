Current limitation is that wont be able to log polls that are sent to individuals without an account
	- fix should be to log based on cell phone number, and then update that database entry if/when an account is made

- Answers shouldnt be in the database as text, but rather in a normalized manner
- viewing historical polls
- when clicking back button on viewing created histoirical poll, brings you to create poll creen
- Confirmation view safe area isnt big enough
- Proper handling for bad log in creds
- Reset password
- User signup email confirmation
